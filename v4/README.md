# V3
This version adds new cost functions (Mean Square Error and Categorical Cross Entropy) and a new activation function layer type, softmax, which allows for more than just binary classification.  
Softmax outputs a probability matrix where each entry of a row represents the probability that observation belongs to the class corresponding to that column. In combination with one of the newly added cost functions, this allows for more complex classification tasks, with more than just two possible classes.
